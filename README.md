1.Why you designed your page like this?
 - I decided to design my page the way it is so it can be easy and interesting to follow along. I believe that the layout I have adopted for this assessment is suitable for websites with educational and entertaining purposes.
 The color selection I chose for the website, is inspired by the most predominant colors of my hometown and the nature around it, therefore I mainly used green and blue in the design.

2.What challenges you faced?
 - The most significant challenge I faced during the website development was the lack of image sources. Part of the information, I was hoping to include, did not have images to accompany it in an interesting way. 
 Another challenge I came across were the credentials for the images I used. I aimed to pay as much attention as possible to the copyright of all the photos that have been used in the creation of this website.
