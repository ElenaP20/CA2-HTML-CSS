      <h4>Ancient history</h4>
      <p> Sofia was founded in the 8th century BCE by a Thracian tribe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdi">Serdi </a>who established a settlement there. Not long after that the settlement was conquered by the Romans in 29 BCE, who gave its name - Serdica. Serdica flourished under the reign of emperor Trajan and Constantine I the Great and was known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Serdica">Council of Serdica</a>, an important meeting site of Christian bishops. </p>
      <p>Under the rule of emperor Justinian the Church of St. Sofia, that was raided by the Huns in 441, was restored and later gave the town its name. The Bulgarian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krum">khan Krum</a> from the first Bulgarian Empire integrated the town with the Bulgarian state and gave it the name Sredets in 809. Before the establishment of the second Bulgarian Empire in 1185, Sredets was under Byzantine rule for 167 years. </p>
      <p>In 1382 the Bulgarian Empire fell to the Turks and wasn't liberated until 1878 by the Russian troops. Sredets was named Sofia after the church of St. Sophia in 1376, but the new name didn't fully replace the old one until the 16th century and in 1879 Sofia was apointed as the capital.</p>

            <p>Sofia reflects its rich heritage as a delightful mix of ancient and modern. From architecture to cuisine and even lifestyle, the Roman, Greek and Ottoman historical role had its impact on the capital that's seen today. Some architectural establishments are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Saint_George,_Sofia">Byzantine Church of St.George</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banya_Bashi_Mosque"> Banya Bashi Mosque</a>, built by the Ottomans in the 16th century and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Synagogue"> the Sofia Synagogue</a>, which is said to be Europe's largest Sephardic synagogue.</p>
